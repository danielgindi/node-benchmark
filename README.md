# benchmark

[![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/benchmark-util.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/benchmark-util)

This is a small utility that supports:
* Benchmarks
* `async` functions (on top of simple synchronous functions)
* `.abort()` in order to, well, abort!
* Defining multiple units to benchmark (`.add(name, function)`)
* Defining prepare and teardown callbacks (`.add(name, { prepare, unit, teardown })`)
* Decide how you want to present the results on your own
* Do a warmup run before running benchmarks for each unit (`.setWarmupTime(milliseconds)`)
* Set up time for benchmarking each unit (`.setMaxUnitTime(milliseconds)`) 
* Set up how many runs to do for each unit, which is useful for detecting deviations and unstable behavior (`.setRunsPerUnit(runs)`)
* `await benchmark.run(options)` for compatibility with modern `await` syntax or `.then`/`.catch`
* There are JSDocs for everything, which should make intellisense much easier and stricter.

## Installation:

```
npm i benchmark-util
```
  
## Usage example:

```javascript
(async () => {
    const Benchmark = require('benchmark-util');
    
    let bench = new Benchmark();
    
    bench
        .add(`Test performance of tiger`, () => {
            /running tiger/.test('Find a running tiger in this string');
        })
        .add(`Test performance of async tigers`, (() => {
            async function lookForRunningTiger() {
                return /running tiger/.test('Find a running tiger in this string');
            }
            
            return async () => {
                await lookForRunningTiger();
            };
        })())
        .add(`Test performance of async tigers with Promise`, async () => {
            await new Promise(resolve => {
                resolve(/running tiger/.test('Find a running tiger in this string'));
            });
        })
        .add(`Test with prepare & teardown`, {
            prepare: () => console.log('This is me preparing'),
            unit: () => {
                /running tiger/.test('Find a running tiger in this string');
            },
            teardown: () => console.log('This is me tearing it down'),
        });
    
    let results = await bench.run({
        onCycle: ({ name, totals, samples, warmup }) => {
            console.log(`${name} x ${Math.round(totals.avg)} ops/sec Â± ${Math.round((totals.stdDev / totals.avg) * 10000) / 100}% (${totals.runs} runs sampled)`);
        }
    });
    
    let fastest = results.sort((a, b) => a.totals.avg > b.totals.avg ? -1 : a.totals.avg < b.totals.avg ? 1 : 0)[0].name;
    
    console.log(`Fastest is: ${fastest}`);
})();

```
